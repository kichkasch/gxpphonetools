README for GXP Phone Tools

GXP Phone Tools is a selection of tiny programs I created for managing my VoIP SIP Phone
Grandstream GXP 2000 (http://www.grandstream.com/products/gxp_series/gxp2000/gxp2000.html).

Check the files in the subfolders. READMEs and instructions / files for installing or using
the programs are provided in there.

First source of information is its home page:
