README for GXPContactManager

GXP Contact Manager enables users to keep phone numbers on a Grandstream GXP 2000 VoIP phone
up to date by pulling from your computer through a web server.

The web server (PHP) creates an XML file, which can be processed by the GXP phone. Available backends 
for creating the XML file are SQL database or LDAP. With the SQL version there is also an HTML
user interface available in order to manage contacts.
